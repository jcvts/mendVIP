# MendVIP Integration Engineer Coding Challenge

The Challenge consists basically in retrieving XML data from a web API, treat it and convert it into a JSON string.

# Prerequisites

Before using the script, make sure your python installation folder is included in your PATH system variables.

**For Windows:** If you're installing python now, make sure you select the option "Add Python to Path".

# Notes

This is a very basic script i created for the challenge, since i didn't have much time for it. I will improve it with time, and scale it a bit, later on. Pull requests and contributions to the program are welcome as well.
